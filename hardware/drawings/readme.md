Some .stl file realized for 3D printed parts and block diagrams.


- bogus_finger.stl is a 3D model of the device. Many parts are just schematics to guide the user during the assembling procedures
- control_box.stl is the 3D part that hosts the buttons (to be printed)
- finger_mold.stl and mold_hat.stl are 2 pieces to print in order to mold a semi-sphere (to be placed under the load cell during the measurments)
- pcb_3x_case*.stl are containers for the PCB model 356a17 accelerometer. Contaiers may be attach to the load cell
- b&k_case.stl is a container for the 4517-C B&K accelerometer. This contaier may be attach to the load cell
